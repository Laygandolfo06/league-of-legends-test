# league-of-legends-test
What you see is an experimental site on League of Legends champions, in each champion its characteristics, types of attacks, abilities with animations, and links for runes are defined. The champions are sorted alphabetically and by lane, you can create lists and compare them. An update is coming where I will add new champions.
